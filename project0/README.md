Sustainable Food Site Introduction

My project is based on a personal interest of mine and this website exhibits the skills I have gained so far. The website facilitates the educating 
of viewers on sustainable food choices and the ability to find local stores in their area. In the future I aim to fully develop this idea and create 
a fully functioning website. I have turned to learning code so I can contribute my design skills and gain understanding of how the interfaces I design 
function. Throughout the project I have implemented all the requirements of this task and attempted to code them with best practice. The course so far has
massively developed my skills and I enjoyed building an application for a cause I'm interested in. 

HTML Pages: 

Every page is accessible on every page through the bootstrap navbar and dropdown. The navbar responds to screen size and transforms into a burger menu for small screen sizes.
A dropdown menu comes down from one of the nav headings which has a subtle hover effect. The 'Get The App' button is also attached to the bootstrap navbar which is intended
to navigate the user to the app download page. Hover effects were produced using SCSS nesting and overriding the existing bootstrap styling for this. This nesting also 
utilises variables created for the link and hover colours. Primary, Secondary and Accent colours are assigned to variables which are used within some areas of 
the site. 

Homepage: 

On the homepage there is a full width bootstrap jumbotron which is responsive and eye catching. The button takes the user to the 'About' page. The call to action 
section is created the same way and the link takes the user to the 'Shop Local' page. Below these there is a responsive bootstrap category grid. The column sizes change
depending on screen size and the thumbnails become singular for small screens. 


Carbon Footprint page:

Fully responsive table where the columns condense and become small sections on small screens. In order for it to do this I used a max width mobile media query.
CSS selectors such as :nth-child(n) and pseudo selector ::before allow the table to transform the layout of the information for small screens.


Sustainable Diets page:

This page will allow the user to explore sustainable and healthy recipes depending on their dietary needs. I created four buttons using SCSS inheritance. This was a quick 
way to produce four components which are fundamentally the same, but slightly different styling depending on the class. These are intended to the filter buttons which 
will filter recipes depending on the diet selected.


Stylesheets:

For this project I have used two CSS stylesheets, and one SCSS file which I compiled to one of the CSS. I kept these two stylesheets separate so I can easily navigate my styling 
and prevent overwriting my existing code with SCSS. I quickly realised using SCSS first would have been better to create the overall style of the site. This meant that I
didn't repeat some styling and kept my code more concise. However, in the future I know now to use SCSS for the styling of the site in overall to save time. 


Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my work, I'm currently a UX Graphic Designer and looking for a career change. I find coding and knowing how applications
are built very rewarding. In the future I wish to use my skills to do good and build interfaces that make people's lives better. I am open to constructive feedback and any tips
that you may have for me as I'm new to front end.
